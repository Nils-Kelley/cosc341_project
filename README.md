# Team 21 - COSC 341 Project - RateIt

## Things To Note
- Port 5050: Node,js
- Port 3306: SQL

## (Required):
 - **Node** 
 - **Flutter**
 - **Docker**

## Instructions:
### 1. Clone the repo
### 2. Open Docker & an IDE (use Android Studio if you are NOT using a physical Android device to run the app).
### 3. **IMPORTANT** Replace all instances of '10.0.0.201' with your own LOCAL computer IPV4. 
                    Note: You can find your IPV4 by running the 'ipconfig' command in cmdlet. 
                    - Hold 'ctrl + shift + F' and search '10.0.0.201' in the app directory (where the flutter files are). 
                    Reason: To avoid a SocketException. 
                                 

### 4. Run node.js and docker-compose mysql-db in seperate terminals in the backend directory within your preferred IDE.
### 5. Depends on how you're running the app.
### - 5.1 (If you are running a phyical device and have the flutter console installed):
       - Go to the app dir and insert the command 'flutter run'. This will start the app on you physical device and you are good to go!
### - 5.2 (If you are running Android Studio):
       - Open the app directory and select either a Virtual Device or a Physical Device and run the application by pressing on the green button at the top right.
